## Event Tracker Project

### Overview
This project is back-end for a RESTful web app.

The database contains two tables - one holding information about pets on properties and the other holding info about the owners. The backend is designed to have two of each - JPA entities, repositories, service interfaces and implementation classes, and controllers.
JPA Repository methods allow the user to create, update, edit (put and patch), and delete pets and pet owners. In addition, the user can do multiple other searches, such as search pet by rent range, move in date, etc.

Controller paths currently work in Postman. Over the next couple of weeks, I intend to develop the front-end using JavaScript, Angular, HTML and CSS.
